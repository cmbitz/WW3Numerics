Documentation of recommended code changes to WAVEWATCHIII

by Cecilia Bitz

The pdf in this repository has detailed notes about the new numerics that we recommend to improve the accuracy of the wave spectrum in sea ice. The present WAVEWATCHIII numerics are overly damping in sea ice. When WAVEWATCHIII is coupled to a sea ice model with floes that fracture in waves, there is too little fracture without the recommended code changes. Presumably ocean mixing is too weak in sea ice covered seas too.
